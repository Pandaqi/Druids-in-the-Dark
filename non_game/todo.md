### To-Do

Sound FX:

* Soft whoosh for movement?
* Countdown / Game started
* Order delivered
* When breaking potion
* When changing wildcard/recipe book
* Inventory Pick Up / Empty
* Game Over / Game Win
* When something mutates / order gets customer _in shadow_ => a general "something" happened in shadow feedback

Particles:

* When moving
* When delivering
* When breaking potion?
* When something mutates
* Other machines/situations?

### Polishing / Future To-Do

* Lean more into the "Holes" => breakable cells (after visiting X times), cells that are on/off half the time, etcetera
* Settings + Rebindable controls
* A permanent icon to display if your non-interactive or not => Maybe smaller feedback elements to reveal what ingredients do (as bonuses/curses once delivered)


# DISCARDED IDEAS

### Order Modifiers

Perhaps orders can take one extra property in later levels, such as ...

* COOP SOLUTION: Orders can only be delivered by the right person? (They show a player color as well?)
* MAYBE SOLUTION: Some people want a _crossmark potion_. They will be satisfied if you deliver anything that is NOT a good recipe.
