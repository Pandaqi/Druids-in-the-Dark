### To-Do

* Marketing Image/Logo of game
* Particles when breaking stuff, when moving, when delivering, when something mutates, etcetera
* Soundtrack + SoundFX

## PUBLISHING (don't forget)

* Make Menu the main scene


### Polishing / Future To-Do

* Settings + Rebindable controls
* A permanent icon to display if your non-interactive or not => Maybe smaller feedback elements to reveal what ingredients do (as bonuses/curses once delivered)


# DISCARDED IDEAS

### Order Modifiers

Perhaps orders can take one extra property in later levels, such as ...

* COOP SOLUTION: Orders can only be delivered by the right person? (They show a player color as well?)
* MAYBE SOLUTION: Some people want a _crossmark potion_. They will be satisfied if you deliver anything that is NOT a good recipe.
